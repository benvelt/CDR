# CDR
Charging Data Record Insight Project.

This project is about the handling of CDR files by a processor for charging purposes. Where charging is mediated by processing large files containing CDR records describing services consumed by subscribers.
Each CDR record contains descriptions of charging events such as voice calls and SMS messages with all relevant data.
The processor will produce billing for subscribers and for third party operators that were involved in the service.

OS used to develope the project is Linux.
There is Makefile to compile and run the code.
In the etc folder there is a CDR maker program for testing of the program.
